      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Pi-hole is a network-wide ad and tracker blocking service that acts as a DNS sinkhole. Once installed on a small server typically on a Raspberry Pi but can work on any device. Pi-hole intercepts DNS queries and blocks known ad, tracker, and malicious domains using blocklists. It protects every device on your network without installing software on each device.</p>

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>Pi-hole runs a DNS server that answers DNS queries for devices on your network. When a hostname appears on a blocklist, Pi-hole responds with dropping the request, this prevents ads or tracker from loading. It typically forwards allowed queries to an upstream resolver.</p>

      <h3>Why to implement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Network-wide ad and tracker blocking</li>
        <li>Improved privacy by reducing connections to tracking domains.</li>
        <li>Reduced bandwidth and fewer unwanted requests, sometimes speeding up page loads.</li>
        <li>Centralized management and statistics via a web admin interface.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Setup</h3>
      <p>Official Pi-hole installs and setups are documented on their offical website.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose a host: Raspberry Pi, small Linux VM, or Docker container.</li>
        <li>Install Pi-hole using the official installer or container image.</li>
        <li>Configure your router or individual devices to use the Pi-hole host as their DNS server.</li>
        <li>Open the web admin console to review blocked queries, whitelist/blacklist domains, and tune blocklists.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Administration & features</h3>
      <p>The Pi-hole web interface provides real-time statistics, long-term graphs, query logs, and tools to manage blocklists, whitelists, and blacklists. Advanced features include conditional forwarding, DHCP server integration, and integration with upstream DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS providers.</p>
